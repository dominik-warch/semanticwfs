Semantic WFS with a Linked Data Backend

This project is a Java wrapper connecting to a triple store and exposing results of SPARQL queries including a geometry literal as a WFS geospatial webservice.

The project maps FeatureTypes to SPARQL queries and allows the configuration of said SPARQL queries in a webinterface.
